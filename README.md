# Listen To A Custom Document Event From Cypress Test

The test [cypress/integration/spec.js](./cypress/integration/spec.js) shows how the Cypress test can listen to the custom DOM events sent to the `document` object. Watch the video [Listen To The Application Dispatching Events To The Document](https://youtu.be/h3O-ZxIItPk).

The spec also shows how the Cypress test can confirm a custom event sent to the `ref.current` element by the React code. Watch the video [Testing DOM Events Sent to ref.current Element By React App](https://youtu.be/Uo99lvfZLJQ)
